'''
Regular Polygons: polysum
A regular polygon has 'n' number of sides. Each side has length 's'.
* The area of regular polygon is: (0.25*n*s^2)/tan(pi/n)
* The perimeter of a polygon is: length of the boundary of the polygon
Write a function called 'polysum' that takes 2 arguments, 'n' and 's'. 
This function should sum the area and square of the perimeter of the regular
 polygon. The function returns the sum, rounded to 4 decimal places.
