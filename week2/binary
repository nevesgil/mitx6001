# what about floats ???

# if we multiply a decimal number by a power of 2
# big enough to convert it all to integer...
# then we convert this integer to binary and divide it back 
# by the same power of two to have the float we want

# example: 0.375 * (2**3) = 3.0 ... converted into 11 in binary
# then divide by the same power of two
# remember, this is now a binary number. so that means this division is 
# actually shiftting the number to the right how many times the power is
# in this case, 3 times (2**3)
# the result then is 0.011
